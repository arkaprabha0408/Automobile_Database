Table Structure contains code to create all the 8 tables..
Also two additional tables stylemodels and dealermodels were created to potray the many to many relation between (option,model) table and (model,dealer) table.
Procedures are introduced to check whether a vehicle can have the desired style based upon it's model as all the models are not available in all styles.
Same goes with the sales where by retrieving the vehicle's model a procedure is used to check whether the dealer sells the said model or not.
